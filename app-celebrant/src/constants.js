    <h2>Full time singer/songwriter from Scotland</h2>
    <p>
      Amy Hawthorn is from West Lothian, Scotland. A professional singer for the
      last 15 years and performing for the last 21, Amy has literally been
      singing her whole life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting at school and in local singing competitions as a youngster and
      then getting involved with the local Stage School in 2002, it was from
      here she started singing lessons with Fred O&apos;Neil, singing teacher to
      Susan Boyle. He got Amy very involved in the jazz scene and she was hooked
      on the open mic nights, singing songs from the likes of Ella Fitzgerald,
      Sarah Vaughan and Etta James.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she was 18, Amy was singing in bars with close friends. She
      then entered Live and Unsigned in 2009 and after being named one of the
      top 5 unsigned acts in Northern Britain, her confidence soared. From here
      she joined a local studio &apos;Banana Row&apos;, in Edinburgh, and became
      one of their session singers, performing at weddings and parties. Amy also
      started her own little event business &apos;Hot Jazz&apos; which consisted
      of herself and 4 musicians. She became her own agent and got wedding and
      party gigs.

      Not long after, in July 2010, her good friend, Leon Jackson, asked Amy to
      be his support act for his show at the Glasgow 02 ABC. A true highlight
      for Amy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following year, in September 2011, Amy received an exciting offer to
      fly to Dubai and become a full time Jazz singer. She went on to be there
      for two years.
    </p>
    <p>
      In July 2013 Amy got signed to Music Comes First Records and her DÃ©but
      single and video, &apos;Hungry For You&apos;, shot to number 1 on the
      iTunes Jazz charts. Her second single, &apos;Rhythm of the Rain&apos; shot
      to number 3 on the iTunes Country charts, beating the likes of Taylor
      Swift. Amy&apos;s singles are available for download via iTunes, Amazon,
      Spotify and most online outlets.

      At the start of 2016, Legion Scotland offered Amy the title of
      &apos;Legion Scotland Sweetheart&apos; which she accepted with great pride
      and is currently performing and appearing at their events nationally and
      internationally.
